The frontend is built with **React** and **Material UI** for a sleek, responsive user interface. **ChromaDB**, a vector database, supports efficient cosine similarity searches, enabling advanced querying capabilities. Python **FastAPI** serves as the backend, providing a high-performance and scalable API for handling requests.
